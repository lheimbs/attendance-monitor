# Introduction

In todays university life, practical courses or laboratories are often attendance-based.
Attendance sheets are used to record students attendance.
These need manual analysis to determine wether a student has successfully participated.
To automate the attendance monitoring and ease the analysis of instructors, a indoor localisatiuon service is proosed.

While GPS and cell-tower based localisaiton is often used in outdoor environments, these are not suitable in an indoor environment, such as an university.
To facilitate accurate indoor localisation services a different approach is needed:
Wireless probe-requests are used by wifi-enabled devices like smartphones to find and auto connect to known access-points.
